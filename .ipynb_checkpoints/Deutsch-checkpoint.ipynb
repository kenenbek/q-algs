    "In classical world we have two possible outcomes for bit: either $0$ or $1$. The same can be applied to quantum bit or so-called qubit. Qubit also can be in a state $0$ or $1$. Physicist wished to separate the state of classical bit from quantum bit. They invented a special notation called bra-ket notation. So, in quantum world $0$ becomes $|0 \\rangle$,  $1$ transforms to $|1 \\rangle$, $0101$ turns into $|0101 \\rangle$ and so on.\n",

For illustration purposes, we can use the unit circle, it means that our circle has the radius of one and position of the circle's center is located in (0, 0) point. "
